# team-profile

## Description
The purpose of this project was to build a team profile generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about a certain type of employee (manager, engineer, or intern). Once an employee's information has been added, the user can then continue adding more employees. The user can input any number of team members and questions will differ depending on the type of employee. 

Once the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that can be viewed in any browser to display each employee as a profile.

This project was generated using Node.js and utilizes the Inquirier package (for user input) and Jest (for testing).

## Installation
To begin installation, you must clone the repository to your local machine. After cloning, you can open the directory using your local command line (Terminal or Git Bash). 

Once you have opened the application on your computer, simply input "node index.js" into your command line to run it. 

You can view the video instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy2x4KYtdus&feature=youtu.be).

## Usage
To use this application, simply follow the prompted questions in the terminal once the application will run. Once you tell the application that you would no longer like to continue inputting employees, a message will appear and direct you to the HTML page. You can then open that page in your browser to view the roster.
